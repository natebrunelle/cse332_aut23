## Meetings

In Person lectures will be held in Gates (i.e. CSE2) room G20 at 12:30pm-1:20pm

Lecture attendance is optional, but strongly encouraged. In the event you are unable to attend a lecture, recordings of lectures are automatically posted to Canvas under the Panopto tool.

For communication about course content, the Ed Discussion Board is preferred to email.
For communication about personal circumstances, email or is preferred.
If you email, include either "CSE 332", "332", or "Data Structures" in the subject line to prevent your email from skipping my inbox and never getting read.

Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except at the scheduled on-the-clock times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don't put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.


## Readings

There is no required textbook for this class. If you would like to consult a text to reinforce your learning, we recommend:

*Introduction to Algorithms*, Third Edition by Cormen, et. al. (ISBN 0262033844).
UVA Library makes a digital version of our textbook [available online](https://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6757775).

Readings corresponding to each lecture will be posted on the course schedule.


## Lectures

I do my best to make lectures as valuable, engaging, and enlightening as possible for all
students. For a schedule of lecture topics, please see the [course webpage](schedule.html).
Although we believe nearly all students will benefit from attending all classes, we also respect that as mature (ideally) college students, you are entrusted to figure out how best to learn and make use of your time here. Hence, I will not have any in-class activities which impact your grade with the exception of the already-posted in-class exams (midterm and final). I will make a best effort to post all lecture materials (recordings, slides documents, etc.) on the course webpage, including video recordings of lectures. Be advised that there are occasional technical difficulties which sometimes cause the recordings to fail, and even when they do succeed these recordings may not be an adequate substitute for attending class live.



## Tasks {#tasks}

All assignments will be posted, and submitted either in class (for exams) or on Gradescope. All grading will be conducted on Gradescope. You will be asked to perform three kinds of evaluations:

- **Exercises**: Open-resource assessments of your understanding of broad course topics. These are intended to verify that you develop and maintain an intuitive understanding of the course concepts. These must be completed independently. You will have 60 minutes from the time that you first open a quiz to submit it. This includes any time required to scan/photograph and upload any work completed by hand, so please be familiar with the tool you will use to do this (and verify it is operational) before beginning the quiz.
- **Programming Projects**: Algorithms for you to implement in either Java or Python (your choice). These may require that you design novel algorithms to implement or implement an algorithm provided to you. These are designed to provide opportunities for you to develop working familiarity with course concepts. "Whiteboard-only" collaboration with a small work group of up to 3 people (yourself plus 2) is encouraged. Code may not be shared with, viewed by, or shown to anyone outside of the course staff. These tasks are more "bite-sized" in that they're expected to be completable in 1-2 sittings.
- **Exams**: Problems for you to solve, submitted as a LaTeX-generated pdf. These may require that you design novel algorithms or compose formal mathematical arguments. These are meant to provide opportunities for you exercise and hone your skills with course concepts. If you choose to collaborate with a group, you must construct one collaborative submission for your entire group. If you are not in a group, "Whiteboard-only" collaboration with a small work group of up to 3 people (yourself plus 2) is acceptable.  These problem sets are longer, and the tasks typically require deeper insight than those on the programing assignments. You are given longer to do them mostly to allow you time for more sittings. I suggest working on the problems in several 1-2 hours sessions, rather than trying to "cram" a set of solutions.

# Grading

We will consider the grade assigned by the following weighted average to be a **guideline** for calculating grades.

Task                        Weight  Comments
-------------------------  -------- ----------------------------------------------
Exercises                   25%     There will be about 16 total, the lowest 2 will be dropped. 
Programming Projects        35%     There will be 3 total
Exams                       40%     Midterm weighted 15%, Final weighted 25%

This numerical calculation is to be considered a **guideline** on your score in the course. Final grades may take other factors into account so that your grade is the most accurate reflection of your understanding of course materials.

## Deadlines

Here are non-exhaustive lists of pre-approved and pre-declined reasons for an extension.

The following reasons are NOT sufficient justification for an extension:

- Congestion of assignments/exams/projects/etc. with other courses
- Confusion on course material
- Mild illness
- Job Interviews (tasks are released with sufficient lead time that you can plan around it)
- Club activities or non-varsity sports
- Non-working code
- Most other foreseeable circumstances

The following reasons would be acceptable justification for an extension:

- Official Accommodation
- Severe Illness
- Personal or Family Tragedy
- Legal Obligations
- Varsity Athletics Competitions
- Religious Observances

## Regrades

We acknowledge that professors and TAs are people (glad to get that confession off of my chest!), and people make mistakes. For this reason, you are able to request regrades on assignments within either one week of your grade being returned or by 11:59pm on Dec 12, which ever date is sooner. 

Please only submit a regrade request if you believe the rubric was misapplied to your submission or if there was a keying error for the task. In the case of a misapplication of the rubric, identify specifically what in your submission demonstrates the misapplication and suggest how you believe the rubric should be correctly applied. In the case of a keying error, state and justify why your believe your answer should be considered correct. Disagreement with the existance or weighting of a rubric item is not considered a valid reason for a regrade request.

# Miscellanea

## Pledge

All students of CS3100 are expected to abide by the [course pledge](pledge.html).

## Professionalism

Behave professionally.

Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes.
Kindness is more important than correctness.

Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.

Lack of professionalism has an overall detrimental impact on our community of learning.

## Honesty

I always hope everyone will behave honestly.
I know we all are tempted to do what we ought not;
if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell me the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.

### No plagiarism (nor anything like it)

For Exercises and Programming Projects you may use external materials with the following restrictions:

- You must attempt each task individually first, other resources should not be consulted until you are "stuck".
- You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.
- You **may not** collaborate or seek help from any interactive source except for members of the course staff or other currently-enrolled CSE332 students (this means you may not seek assistance from former CSE332 students, online forums like Chegg or Stackoverflow, or generative AI systems like Chat-GPT).
- You **must** cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (see list above). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your/your cohort's own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: "I collaborated with Brett Wortzman on the implementation of the peek method, I consulted \url{https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_variables_print.asp} for help with java print syntax, Miya Natsuhara helped me to debug the for loop that begins on line 107 of my code."
- All one-on-one collaborations with classmates must be "whiteboard only" (defined below).
- Do not seek "hints" or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only. (For example, do not consult a GitHub repository posted by a former student.)

#### Whiteboard Only Collaboration

"Whiteboard Only" collaboration is meant to convey the type of discussion where participants gather around a whiteboard to solve a problem together, without taking any notes from their discussion, and then erasing the whiteboard before they disperse. 

In particular, you may discuss tasks and their solutions, but the only thing you may take away from your discussion is your brain. This means you may not produce any records or artifacts from your collaborations, including: notes, screenshots, photos, figures, audio/video recordings, documents (inluding google docs), links, or any other digital or tangible thing. Nor may you share any files, links, etc. with other students outside of a collaboration session. Any substantially similar expression of the same solution can only occur if collaboration extends beyond "whiteboard only", and so will be considered as evidence of a policy violation.


## Personal accommodations

### Special Circumstances

The University of Washington strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you
require an accommodation to fully access this course, please work with the Disability Resources for Students (DRS). If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or
to learn more about their services, begin by visiting [the DRS website](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/).
For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably
during the **first week of class** or as soon as accomodations are approved.

### Religious observances

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or
significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The
UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available
at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two
weeks of this course using [the Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/).

### Safe Environment

I am dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning enironment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I hold as critically important:

1. Power-based violence is not to be tolerated
1. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community in the classroom and on campus.

f you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, I encourage you to use Safecampus as a resource. As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources to the best of my ability. 

Additionally, if at any point you are made to feel uncomfortable, disrespected, or excluded by a staff
member or fellow student, please report the incident so that we may address the issue and maintain a
supportive and inclusive learning environment. Should you feel uncomfortable bringing up an issue
with a me or another staff member directly, you may consider contacting the
[Office of the Ombud](https://www.washington.edu/ombud/).

### Life

Bad things happen.
People forget things and make mistakes.
Bad days coincide with due dates.
Etc.

If you believe that circumstances warrant an change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we'll resolve the situation as best we can.

If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here
who are ready and wanting to help. The Student Health Center offers Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) for all UVA students. Call 434-243-5150 (or 434-972-7004 for after hours and weekend
crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment. If you prefer to speak anonymously and
confidentially over the phone, Madison House provides a HELP Line at any hour of any day: 434-295-8255.
