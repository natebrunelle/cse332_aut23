## Anjali Agarwal

Hi, I'm Anjali (she/her)! I'm a CS Master's student at the Allen School. During my free time, I like to play board games, watch movies, and learn math (shoutout to 3Blue1Brown and Veritasium :D). This is my 14th quarter as a CSE TA or instructor, but my first time as a TA for 332. I really look forward to working with you this quarter!

## Nile Camai

Hi everyone! My name is Nile (he/him) and I'm a fourth-year CS student and fifth-time TA for CSE 332. I've lived in the Seattle area my whole life. Some of my interests include cooking, fashion, and mechanical keyboards. Looking forward to a fun quarter!

## Hans Easton

Hello, my name is Hans! I grew up in Shanghai and moved to Seattle 7 years ago. This is my sixth time TAing for this course, and I am excited to get to know all of you! Fun fact about me is that I spent half a year living in Hawaii last year try to learn surfing. I also love traveling, my most recent favourite being Mexico City! Feel free to chat with me about your projects, course material, internship hunting tips, etc :)

## Arya GJ

Hi everyone! I'm Arya. I am a 5th year BSMS student from Bangalore, India. CSE 332 is the most interesting 300-level CS course I've taken and I am very excited to TA this course again (for the 7th time LOL). I am an avid sports fan; pretty much watch everything from football (soccer) to NBA to F1. I am a big music person too, so definitely drop any suggestions. Feel free to reach out about recruiting, technical interview prep, general CS advice, or literally anything random :)

## Allyson Mangus

Hi, I'm Allyson (she/her)! I'm a third-year CS major and fourth-time TA from Renton, WA. In my free time, I enjoy reading, sketching, and drinking coffee. By the number of hours per year, I probably spend the most time listening to music and being sunburned

## Chandni Rajasekaran

Hi! My name is Chandni and I am currently a fourth year student majoring in computer science. I am super excited to TA this course again since I've come to see that everything I've learned in this class has been very applicable to internship preparation. Outside of school, I really enjoy drawing and baking. As a shameless plug, I have an instagram account where I post my photorealistic color pencil drawings (username: @chandnidraws). I can't wait to meet everyone this quarter!

## Aashna Sheth

## James Richie Sulaeman

Hi everyone! I'm James, a Computer Science and Mathematics senior from Jakarta, Indonesia. When I'm not drowning in my assignments, you can find me swinging a tennis racket or hitting the slopes on my snowboard (for as long as there is still snow). I'm thrilled to be part of CSE 332 this quarter and can't wait to work with all of you.

## Amanda Yuan

Hi, I'm Amanda. I'm a fourth year CS student and this will be my fifth time TA-ing for CSE 332. I like salted caramel and large hair claws. Best of luck this quarter!

## Mohamed Awadalla

Hi! I'm Mohamed Awadalla, and I'm a junior and third-time TA for 332. Although I was born in Cairo, Egypt, I've lived most of my life here in Seattle. When I'm not coding, I love watching F1 and anything that has to do with motorsport. I also love playing sports, mainly squash, soccer, and padel. Looking forward to a great autumn quarter!
