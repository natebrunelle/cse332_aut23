# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Exercise 1 asks you to perform asymptotic running time analysis on given Java code. You can find Exercise 1 on Gradescope.

## Exercise 2

Exercise 2 asks you to manually manipulate heaps. You can find Exercise 2 on Gradescope.

## Exercise 3

Exercise 3 asks you to solve recurrence relations, you can find Exercise 3 on Gradescope.

## Exercise 4

Exercise 4 asks you to perform insertions into AVL Trees and B Trees, you can find Exercise 4 on Gradescope.

## Exercise 5

Exercise 5 is a programming assignment that asks you to write Java code which checks whether a given tree is a valid AVL tree. We have created a gitlab repository for you containing the description and starter code for this exercise. You will submit on Gradescope.

# Projects

Links to projects will be posted here as they become available.

To complete the projects you will need to set up your CSE332 programming environment, which is [outlined in this handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CWj02e1xjJY0J3CG_1tDxiOlDMnd2GU9PKmS5sskfXU/edit?usp=sharing).

If you have a pesky bug in your code that you're struggling to track down, try following our [debugging guide](file:///C:/Users/nateb/Downloads/https_courses.cs.washington.edu_courses_cse332_23su_handouts_Handouts%20-%20Debugging%20in%20CSE%20332.pdf).

At the end of each checkpoint we will have a survey. This is intended just for us to keep up with the overall sentiment of class as a whole, and to reach out and help students who request additional support. It's not required fill out the survey, but doing so will give us more information on how we can better serve you!

## Project 1

You can see the description (specification) of project 1 [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Hg9mZngymc2_bSqf4y5U5FcgrqBLs8dux5Eo7ucMNM/edit?usp=sharing).

You can find the code for [project 1 in this gitlab repository](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse332-23au/p1-public). This code is also in a gitlab repositorty we created for you at `gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse332-23au-students/p1-your netid`. You will submit this repository to gradescope for your project submissions (checkpoints and final submission).
