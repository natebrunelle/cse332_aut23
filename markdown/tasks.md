All tasks will be submitted and graded on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/691776).

# Exercises

We will post links to exercises here as they are released.

# Projects

Links to projects will be posted here as they become available.

To complete the projects you will need to set up your CSE332 programming environment, which is [outlined in this handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CWj02e1xjJY0J3CG_1tDxiOlDMnd2GU9PKmS5sskfXU/edit?usp=sharing).

If you want something to reference regarding java generics, check this out: [java generics reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfcUxBdtX30n-eLXy51yBwFuGppGaSbc164qIBUB_VY/edit?usp=sharing).

If you have a pesky bug in your code that you're struggling to track down, try following our [debugging guide](files/debugging_in_cse332.pdf).

At the end of each checkpoint we will have a survey. This is intended just for us to keep up with the overall sentiment of class as a whole, and to reach out and help students who request additional support. It's not required fill out the survey, but doing so will give us more information on how we can better serve you!

## Project 1

You can see the description (specification) of project 1 [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zm_Qwzg_9duBEKwfrA9NTEmNR64fVwNXiH1eg-DCEkU/edit?usp=sharing).

You can find the code for project 1 in this [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse332-24wi/p1-public). This code is also in a gitlab repositorty we created for you at gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse332-24wi-students/p1-yournetid. You will submit this repository to gradescope for your project submissions (checkpoints and final submission).

	- Definitions and relationships between these classes
	- Examples of problems in each

Note: You will likely be asked to write java code using ForkJoin and/or threads. We will not require your syntax to be perfectly correct, but it should be correct enough that we can verify the code's would be correct if syntax issues were fixed. That is, we expect edge cases and other considerations of an algorithm to be correct, but don't necessarily expect all keywords or semicolons to be perfect.

### Past Exams

We have provided links to past exams below. Since all past exams were given by a different instructor, be advised that the question style, length, and difficulty may be different this quarter. I recommend that you mostly use these exams to evaluate your preparedness rather than as a study guide. In summary, question style will be similar to the midterm, quest content will be similar to the exams below.
