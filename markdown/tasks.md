# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Exercise 1 asks you to perform asymptotic running time analysis on given Java code. You can find Exercise 1 on Gradescope.

## Exercise 2

Exercise 2 asks you to manually manipulate heaps. You can find Exercise 2 on Gradescope.

## Exercise 3

Exercise 3 asks you to solve recurrence relations, you can find Exercise 3 on Gradescope.

## Exercise 4

Exercise 4 asks you to perform insertions into AVL Trees and B Trees, you can find Exercise 4 on Gradescope.

## Exercise 5

Exercise 5 is a programming assignment that asks you to write Java code which checks whether a given tree is a valid AVL tree. We have created a gitlab repository for you containing the description and starter code for this exercise. You will submit on Gradescope.

# Projects

Links to projects will be posted here as they become available.

To complete the projects you will need to set up your CSE332 programming environment, which is [outlined in this handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CWj02e1xjJY0J3CG_1tDxiOlDMnd2GU9PKmS5sskfXU/edit?usp=sharing).

If you want something to reference regarding java generics, check this out: [java generics reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfcUxBdtX30n-eLXy51yBwFuGppGaSbc164qIBUB_VY/edit?usp=sharing).

If you have a pesky bug in your code that you're struggling to track down, try following our [debugging guide](file:///C:/Users/nateb/Downloads/https_courses.cs.washington.edu_courses_cse332_23su_handouts_Handouts%20-%20Debugging%20in%20CSE%20332.pdf).

At the end of each checkpoint we will have a survey. This is intended just for us to keep up with the overall sentiment of class as a whole, and to reach out and help students who request additional support. It's not required fill out the survey, but doing so will give us more information on how we can better serve you!

## Project 1

You can see the description (specification) of project 1 [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Hg9mZngymc2_bSqf4y5U5FcgrqBLs8dux5Eo7ucMNM/edit?usp=sharing).

You can find the code for [project 1 in this gitlab repository](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse332-23au/p1-public). This code is also in a gitlab repositorty we created for you at `gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse332-23au-students/p1-your netid`. You will submit this repository to gradescope for your project submissions (checkpoints and final submission).

# Exams

## Exam 1

The Midterm Exam will be held on Monday October 30 during our normal lecture session (12:30-1:20pm in CSE2 G20).

### Policies

1. Closed book, closed notes
1. No calculators, cell phones, or other electronic devices allowed.
1. No writing after time is called, make sure you put your name on your paper first.
1. You will be provided a reference sheet during the exam (will be linked here).

### Content

The exam will cover all material from the beginning of the quarter up through hashing. This includes:

- Abstract Data Types and Data structures:
	- Their Definitions and Differences
	- Examples
- Stacks and Queues:
	- Array and Linked List implementations and running times
	- ADT Operations
- Asymptotic Complexity:
	- Definition of big-oh, big-omega, big-theta
	- Identifying whether f(n) belongs to O(g(n)) (or big-omega, big-theta)
	- Finding constants c and n0 to demonstrate this
	- Identifying running times (best case and worst case) of example code
- Recurrence Relations:
	- Given a recurrence relation, solve it to closed form
- Priority Queues:
	- ADT operations (insert, findMin, deleteMin, increaseKey, decreaseKey, remove)
	- The Heap data structure (including the heap property, complete tree, and buildHeap)
- Tries:
	- Find, insert, and delete operations
- Trees:
	- Definitions of height, branching factor
	- Preorder, Inorder, Postorder traversals of binary trees
- Dictionaries:
	- ADT operations
	- Binary Search Trees: Definition, algorithms and running times of dictionary operations
	- AVL Trees: Definition, algorithms and running times of dictionary operations (including the definition of rotations and when to do them). The delete operation will NOT be covered.
	- B-Trees: Definition and motivation, algorithms and running times of dictionary operations.

### Past Exams

We have provided links to past exams below. Since all past exams were given by a different instructor, be advised that the question style, length, and difficulty may be different this quarter. I recommend that you mostly use these exams to evaluate your preparedness rather than as a study guide.
